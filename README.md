It's a work in progress and in active development. 

[Click here to test content-v3](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/tt5-demo-blueprint/main/blueprint-v3.json)
- It's a work in progress and in active development. 
- The import file was not changed from the Export script. 
- the blueprint uses the importer of the ``data-liberation`` option.
